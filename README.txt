This is where I will share small JS libraries and sketches as I create them. There's not much here yet, but it will grow over time.

All class files are released under MIT. Other assets are copyright their respective copyright holders.

Here is a list of the libraries you will find here:

** _Sketches **
Smaller sketches that are incomplete or less significant, but still worth sharing.
	* Nothing here yet.

** Rndm **
Provides simple methods for working with random values, such as Rnd.float(min, max), and Rnd.sign(). Also includes a seeded random version, Rndm.
